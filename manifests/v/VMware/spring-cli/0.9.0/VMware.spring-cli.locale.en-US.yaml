ShortDescription: Spring CLI improves your productivity when creating new Spring projects or adding functionality to existing projects
Description: |
  The goal of the Spring CLI is to increase your productivity when creating new
  projects and adding functionality to existing projects. It does this by
  providing the following high-level features.
  
  The command boot new clones an external project and optionally perform a package
  refactoring to your chosen package name. You can also optionally specify the new
  project’s group id, artifact id, and version
  
  The command boot add will merge an external project to your current project. It
  performs an intelligent merge of project dependencies, plug-ins, annotations,
  application configuration files, and refactoring of the external project code
  into your current project’s package structure.
  
  User-provided commands provide a user-friendly way to define and execute custom
  commands that can perform everyday tasks on your project. With declarative command
  definitions living alongside your code, you can easily create new controllers,
  add dependencies, or configure files. You can also execute other command-line
  applications as needed resembling a client-side GitHub Actions like experience.
